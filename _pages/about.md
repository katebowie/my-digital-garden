Hi! I'm Kate. I'm currently a PhD student in biomedical engineering at Oregon Health and Science University. I'm a human microbiome researcher with a penchant for backpacking, riding motorcycles, and King of the Hill. My main focus is studying the types of microbes that make their way into the blood and the bladder of men with prostate cancer. Although I work constantly, this will be a space for science *and* my other interests, like my love for King of the Hill. Let's be real here: I think we all are in dire need of a website that does an in-depth literature search into lower urinary tract symptoms in men while keeping Hank Hill's narrow urethra in mind.
